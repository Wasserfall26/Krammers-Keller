This is my Mod for Hypixel Skyblock!

I’ve spent most of my time gaming in Skyblock, and for almost just as long, I’ve been coding this mod to perfect my own experience.
It started as a personal project to add features I always wanted and none of my other mods had. Some people in my friend group asked me if they could use the Mod too, so I shared it with them.
But recently I was talking to a close friend of mine who convinced me that others would find my features useful too, so I’ve decided to release it to the public. This is a work of love, built by me, but for everyone to enjoy.
